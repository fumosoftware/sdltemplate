this is a project template for a sdl3 project.
Required:
* Ninja-Build
* Clang-18 (minimum?)

**this project is built with c++20 in mind. it may not work if you are trying to build for 11, 14, or 17**

**if building using cmake --build --preset <debug|release>, the following flags will be used**
* -Wall
* -Wextra
* -Werror

to build this project
1) cmake --preset <debug|release>
2) cmake --build --preset <debug|release>

alternatively, you can build 
1) mkdir build && cd build
2) cmake .. --presets=default
3) make

Note: This has only been tested on a linux machine using clang. It probably will not work on windows, and i have no idea if it will work with gcc (although i dont really see why it shouldn't?)
