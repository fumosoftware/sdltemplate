this is a project template for a sdl3 project.
to build this project:
1) mkdir build && cd build
2) cmake .. --presets=default
3) make

Note: This has only been tested on a linux machine using clang. It probably will not work on windows, and i have no idea if it will work with gcc (although i dont really see why it shouldn't?)
